Huge thanks to [Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) and also [Noran Saber Abdelfattah's Flask blog guide](https://medium.com/@noransaber685/building-a-flask-blog-a-step-by-step-guide-for-beginners-8bffe925cd0e), otherwise this project would've taken longer and would probably have *bad practice* scribbled all over it.

And thank you to GitHub for free image "backups" in my static folders <3
